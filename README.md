# Flexible_Pendulum
This repository contains files pertaining to a one-day project I took up to build the model of a flexible pendulum on SolidWorks 2014, analyze its structural properties on Ansys Workbench 16.2, and evaluate its dynamic motion on Adams Student Edition 2018.1

Disclaimer: The analysis files are not totally complete. However, the present state is also usable for some minimal analysis of properties such as the spring constant, damping coefficient, etc.
