# Flexible_Pendulum
This repository contains files pertaining to a one-day project I took up to build the model of a flexible pendulum on SolidWorks 2014, analyze its structural properties on Ansys Workbench 16.2, and evaluate its dynamic motion on Adams Student Edition 2018.1

The analysis files are not totally complete. However, the present state is also usable for some minimal analysis of properties such as the spring constant, damping coefficient, etc.
